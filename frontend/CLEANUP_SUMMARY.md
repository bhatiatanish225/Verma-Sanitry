2. **`frontend/build-with-patch.sh`** - Removed custom build script causing conflicts
3. **`frontend/metro-patch.js`** - Removed Metro patch interfering with bundler
4. **`frontend/temp-metro-patch/metro.config.js`** - Removed problematic Metro configuration
5. **`frontend/.metro-mock/`** - Removed mock directory and its contents
6. **`backend/patches/fix-path-to-regexp.js`** - Removed backend patch file

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Frontend**: Clean Metro configuration with default Expo setup
‚úÖ **Backend**: Removed patch dependencies and scripts
‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Fresh install with no conflicting resolutions
‚úÖ **Build Process**: Standard Expo build process restored

## What Was Causing The Errors:

1. **500 Internal Server Error**: Fixed nodemailer function name typo
2. **MIME Type Error**: Caused by Metro bundler conflicts from patch files
3. **Message Port Error**: Result of build process conflicts

## Next Steps:

1. The frontend and backend servers should now start without errors
2. You can access the app at `http://localhost:8081`
3. Backend API is available at `http://localhost:5001`
4. Use the admin credentials: `admin@vermaandco.com` / `admin123`

## If Issues Persist:

1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh
2. Restart both frontend and backend servers
3. Check that Redis is running (required for multi-step signup)
4. Verify email configuration in backend `.env` file
